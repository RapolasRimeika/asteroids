# Asteroids Game Project

Welcome to my Asteroids game project! üéÆ This has been a fun and challenging learning exercise where I implemented complex game mechanics, practiced Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) in Python, and refined my skills in Git and GitHub for version control. The game is built with the Pygame library and designed to be modular, maintainable, and scalable.

## What's Inside

- **Language:** Python üêç
- **Libraries:** Pygame for game development, Pillow for image processing (Gaussian blur).

## What I Learned

### Python:
- Practiced writing efficient loops, functions, and working with lists and dictionaries.
- Developed a project with multiple files and managed dependencies effectively.
- Generated temporary local files, such as `high_scores.json`, to store data dynamically.
- Set up and managed a virtual environment for isolating project dependencies.

### Object-Oriented Programming:
- Designed a hierarchy of classes including `CircleShape`, `Player`, `Asteroid`, `Shot`, `FloatingText`, `Loot`, and `AlienShip`.
- Applied key OOP principles like inheritance, encapsulation, and composition to create reusable and flexible game components.
- Utilized sprite groups to optimize the updating and rendering of game objects, improving performance.

### Version Control:
- Managed the project lifecycle using Git and GitHub, efficiently tracking changes and collaborating.
- Gained proficiency in shell/terminal commands for version control and project management tasks.

### The real lessons:
During this project, I gained a deeper understanding of how the complexity of a system grows    exponentially as new features are added. Each new feature invariably led to refactoring existing code, and as the project matured, a significant amount of time was devoted to cleaning up code and documenting it. This experience taught me the importance of iterative refactoring, where improving the structure of existing code becomes just as important as adding new features.

I also experienced firsthand how sunk cost bias can come into play when you‚Äôve invested so much time into a project. There‚Äôs always the urge to continue working and polishing, even when the core functionality is done. However, having a project with instant feedback loops‚Äîwhere I could see results quickly‚Äîwas incredibly motivating and rewarding.

Seeing someone else play a game I built was a proud moment, and it reinforced the sense of accomplishment that comes from creating something tangible and fun.

Moreover, community feedback played a vital role in the game's evolution. The concept of the black hole emerged from a discussion on the [boot.dev](https://www.boot.dev/) discord forum, thanks to the suggestion from "iqzy21 - road to scorcerers". Similarly, the stabilizers mechanic was added because some players found the inertia difficult to manage. These insights shaped the final design, showing how user feedback can drive meaningful improvements.

### Game Mechanics:
- **Player Controls:** 
    Rotate, move, and shoot with smooth physics.

**Game State Management:**  
    The game constantly tracks the player's state, including death, and manages transitions between different modes (e.g., playing, game over, name entry). During gameplay, it monitors player score and playtime, updating the game state based on player actions and events, ensuring smooth transitions.

- **Player Highscores:**  
    After the game finishes, the player is prompted to enter their name, and the scores are saved. The high score system retains up to 10 entries, showing the leaderboard at the end of the game, giving players the chance to compete for the top spots.

- **Alien Ships:**  
    Alien ships track the player, navigate around asteroids, and strategically shoot when in range. Upon destruction, they drop various loot items, adding dynamic gameplay and resource rewards for the player.

- **Loot System:**  
    Loot spawns upon defeating Alien ships, offering power-ups like health, speed boosts, stabilizers, and other upgrades. Each loot item modifies the ship's attributes, making gameplay progressively more challenging and rewarding.

- **Global Collision:**  
    A robust physics engine governs collisions, where objects not only collide but also take damage based on their relative velocity and mass. The impact forces cause them to bounce off each other, leading to realistic interactions between all in-game objects.

- **Shrapnel:**  
    Upon destruction, objects break apart into multiple shrapnel pieces, the amount of which is determined by their radius. The shrapnel scatters in various directions, colliding with nearby objects and dealing additional damage, enhancing the unpredictability of space combat.

- **Inertia:**  
    The game employs a full physics system with both linear and angular inertia. Spaceships experience friction and momentum, adding a layer of control and realism to movement. While all objects have inertia, non-controllable objects have angular inertia disabled for smoother performance.

- **Stabilizers:**  
    Spaceships (both Player and Alien) have angular momentum and built-in stabilizers to counteract small, unintended movements caused by inertia. This system helps control both linear and angular momentum when movement keys aren't pressed. The stabilizers are upgradable through loot, providing better handling.

- **Black Holes (BlackHole Class):**  
    Black holes spawn randomly in space, pulling in nearby objects based on proximity. As objects get too close, they are pulled in and eventually disappear, introducing an ever-present environmental hazard with gravitational physics.

- **Background Generation:**  
    A complex, multi-layered background system generates star and planet layers with procedurally generated textures. Gaussian blur is applied to the planet layer, creating a sense of depth and immersion in the game‚Äôs expansive space environment.

- **Explosion Physics:**  
    Explosions affect nearby objects based on proximity, applying realistic force dynamics. The closer an object is to the explosion, the greater the force exerted, causing ripple effects across the environment and impacting gameplay significantly.

### Code Modularity:

- The code is split into multiple files for readability, maintainability, and scalability:

  - **`constants.py`**        : Stores global constants like screen dimensions and object sizes.
  - **`state.py`**            : Manages the game states such as playing, game over, and name entry.
  - **`main.py`**             : The main game loop handling events, updates, and rendering.
  
  - **`circle_shape.py`**     : A base class for circular game objects with full inertia and friction.

  - **`player.py`**           : Manages player controls, movement, shooting, and collision detection.
  - **`aliens.py`**           : Handles alien ship behavior and interactions with the player.
  - **`alien_field.py`**      : Manages the spawning and behavior of alien ships.
  
  - **`asteroid.py`**         : Handles asteroid movement, splitting, and texture generation.
  - **`asteroid_field.py`**   : Manages asteroid spawning and interactions with the environment.
  
  - **`loot.py`**             : Implements the loot system with power-ups for the player.
  
  - **`shot.py`**             : Implements the mechanics for player and alien shots.

  - **`explosion.py`**        : Handles explosion physics and their interactions with objects.
  - **`black_hole.py`**       : Manages the behavior and physics of black holes within the game.
  
  - **`background.py`**       : Generates dynamic multi-layered star and planet backgrounds.
  - **`floating_text.py`**    : Displays floating text effects during gameplay.
  - **`text_lists.py`**       : Stores pre-defined text messages or lists for use during gameplay.
  
  - **`high_scores.json`**    : Stores the top player scores after each session.
  - **`requirements.txt`**    : Lists the dependencies required to run the game.
  - **`README.md`**           : Provides an overview and instructions for the game.
